#Contributing Guide
===
##Introduction
We are a small team of developers who would love assistance.  If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork us and submit a pull request, but first, please read through this document in its entirety.  Mahalo!

##Contributing Procedure
So you've found a bug, or you want to add a new feature.  Please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Please only submit one feature request/bug fix per pull request.  This makes it easy for us to manage and keep track of all the code.
2. Please don't make changes that alter the data structure of existing classes (these include `Transaction`s, `XPTransaction`s, `PFUser`s, `Badge`s, and any others that store student or class data).  **Any changes that break the app or our [Parse](https://parse.com) instance will not be accepted.**
3. Please don't make a change that performs a task already performed by Cloud Code, unless it will work more efficiently or faster.  Such changes could potentially create inconsistencies in student/class data sets.

##Side Notes
Even if you don't know how to code, or you'd like to help but don't how, we still value your input.  Feel free to open a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/IolaniEPF/Finance) and provide us with some details.  We will take your feedback into consideration and try our best to keep you in the loop.
